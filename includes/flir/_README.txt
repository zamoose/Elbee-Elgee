Originally, I created Facelift Image Replacement because I didn't like sIFR but still wanted the 
ability to add custom fonts to my websites.  Since then, I've added a lot more functionality and 
FLIR has been downloaded upwards of 7000 times as of this writing.  

If you appreciate FLIR and the time that went into creating it, the plug-ins, the documentation, 
and providing support via the forums, than please think about making a small contribution to the 
project.  

Thank you for downloading FLIR and I hope you find it as useful as I do.

Sincerely,
Cory Mawhorter
